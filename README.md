# Mobile Flashcards Project

In this React Native project, a student can create decks of flashcards. Each deck contains questions and answers that the student added to the deck. At any point, student can take a quiz and evaluate themselves on how many questions they can answer correctly. The app also reminds the student to study everyday if they did not take any quiz that day.
